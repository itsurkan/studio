## Core Features:

- File Upload: Enable users to upload files (text, PDFs, spreadsheets, images) up to a certain size limit.

- RAG Integration: Integrate RAG to provide question-answering and summarization capabilities with configurable output types (bullets, paragraphs) selectable via a UI dropdown.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral white or light grey for a clean, professional look.

- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) for success and key actions, such as confirming a query or displaying a successful upload.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on readability and ease of navigation.
- Use a set of consistent and professional icons for file types, actions, and navigation.
- Subtle animations for loading states and transitions to provide a smooth user experience.
